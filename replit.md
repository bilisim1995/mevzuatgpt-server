# MevzuatGPT

## Overview
MevzuatGPT is a production-ready RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for legal document processing and semantic search. It allows admin users to upload legal PDF documents, which are then processed, vectorized, and made searchable through AI-powered queries. The system provides comprehensive document management with role-based access control, supporting both document search and intelligent question-answering capabilities. It functions as a legal research assistant, enabling users to query complex legal documents in natural language and receive contextually relevant answers with source attribution and confidence scoring.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Backend Framework
The application is built on FastAPI, chosen for its high-performance asynchronous capabilities, automatic OpenAPI documentation, and native Pydantic integration.

### Database and Storage
The system uses a multi-tiered storage approach:
- **Primary Database**: Self-hosted Supabase PostgreSQL at https://supabase.mevzuatgpt.org for authentication/user management/document metadata with Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
- **Vector Storage**: Elasticsearch at https://elastic.mevzuatgpt.org/ for ALL vector operations and similarity search with 1536-dimensional embeddings from OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model.
- **File Storage**: PDF documents are stored on Bunny.net CDN with automatic URL generation to https://cdn.mevzuatgpt.org/documents/ format.
- **Cache Layer**: Redis Cloud provides caching for search results, rate limiting, and session management.

#### Complete Database Schema (Updated August 20, 2025)
All required tables are now present and functional in Supabase:
- `user_profiles` - User authentication and role management
- `mevzuat_documents` - PDF document metadata with filename/file_url support  
- `search_logs` - Query history and analytics
- `ai_prompts` - Dynamic AI prompt management for runtime updates
- `support_tickets` - User support ticket system
- `user_credits` - Credit balance management
- `credit_transactions` - Credit transaction history

Note: Vector embeddings are stored in Elasticsearch, NOT in Supabase database.

### Authentication and Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented via Supabase Auth. Roles include:
- **Admin**: Full document upload, management, and administrative functions.
- **User**: Document search and query capabilities.
JWT tokens are managed by Supabase with automatic refresh and integrated with database-level RLS.

### Document Processing Pipeline
An asynchronous processing pipeline handles documents:
1.  **Upload**: PDFs are uploaded to Bunny.net CDN with metadata stored in `mevzuat_documents` table.
2.  **Text Extraction**: Multi-method PDF parsing using `pdfplumber` with fallbacks.
3.  **Text Chunking**: Intelligent text splitting with overlap preservation using LangChain.
4.  **Vectorization**: Batch embedding generation via OpenAI API with 1536-dimensional vectors.
5.  **Storage**: Vector embeddings stored in Elasticsearch for semantic search and similarity matching.
6.  **Background Processing**: Celery workers manage long-running tasks with Redis queue.

#### PDF URL Resolution System (Fixed August 20, 2025)
A three-tier fallback system ensures all documents have accessible URLs:
1. **Primary**: Use existing `file_url` from database if present
2. **Fallback**: Generate CDN URL from `filename`: `https://cdn.mevzuatgpt.org/documents/{filename}`
3. **Final**: Use `document_title` as filename for URL generation if needed

### AI and Search Architecture
The query processing system supports multiple AI providers with dynamic prompt management:
-   **Primary**: Groq API for fast, cost-effective inference using Llama models.
-   **Fallback**: OpenAI GPT-4o for complex reasoning tasks.
-   **Dynamic Prompts**: AI prompts are stored in Supabase `ai_prompts` table and loaded dynamically at runtime.
-   **Prompt Management**: Admin panel for updating AI behavior without server restart.
-   **Search**: `pgvector`-powered semantic search with configurable similarity thresholds.
-   **Institution Filtering**: Document-level pre-filtering by institution before vector search for performance.
-   **Smart Credit Refund**: Automatic credit refund for "no information found" responses.

### Reliability and Quality Control
A comprehensive confidence scoring mechanism includes:
-   Source Reliability Scoring.
-   Content Consistency Analysis.
-   Technical Accuracy Assessment.
-   Currency Evaluation.

### UI/UX Decisions
The system supports a support ticket system, user credit management, password reset functionality, and advanced query filtering. AI responses are enhanced for length and creativity, with a focus on detailed legal analysis. PDF URL source attribution is integrated for direct document access.

### Password Reset System
A comprehensive password reset system has been implemented with enterprise-grade security:
- **Email-Based Reset**: Users can request password reset via email address
- **Secure Token Management**: Reset tokens are stored in Redis with 24-hour TTL for automatic expiry
- **Email Notifications**: SendGrid integration for professional password reset emails
- **Security Features**: Email enumeration protection, secure token generation, and automatic cleanup
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/auth/forgot-password`: Request password reset
  - `POST /api/auth/reset-password`: Confirm password reset with token
  - `POST /api/auth/verify-reset-token`: Validate reset token

### Dynamic AI Prompt System
Real-time AI behavior management without server restarts:
- **Database-Driven Prompts**: AI prompts stored in Supabase `ai_prompts` table
- **Cached Performance**: 5-minute cache for optimal performance with manual refresh capability
- **Version Control**: Prompt versioning and history tracking for rollback support
- **Admin Management**: Full CRUD operations via `/api/admin/prompts/*` endpoints
- **Fallback Protection**: Default prompts ensure system stability if database unavailable
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Separate prompts for Groq, OpenAI, and future AI providers
