# Support System Status Report

## Current Status: ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **Support endpoint routes** - All API routes are properly registered
2. **Support service logic** - Business logic is implemented
3. **Support schemas** - Data models are defined
4. **Database tables** - Support tables have been created in Supabase

### ❌ Current Issues:
1. **RLS Policy Conflict** - Infinite recursion error in user_profiles policies
2. **Authentication Context** - UserResponse model attribute access issues
3. **Database Permission** - Service role access to support tables needs configuration

## Error Details:

### Main Error:
```
infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "user_profiles"
```

This indicates that the RLS (Row Level Security) policies in Supabase are creating circular dependencies when checking admin permissions.

### Authentication Error:
```
AttributeError: 'UserResponse' object has no attribute 'get'
```

The code was trying to use dictionary-style access on a Pydantic model.

## Files That Need Manual Supabase Configuration:

1. **setup_support_tables.sql** - Complete support system setup
2. **RLS Policies** - Need to be reviewed for circular dependencies

## Next Steps Required:

1. **Fix RLS Policies in Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Review user_profiles table policies
   - Ensure no circular dependencies in admin role checks
   - Test service role access to support tables

2. **Test Support System:**
   - Create test ticket
   - List tickets
   - Admin functionality verification

## API Endpoints Available:

### User Endpoints:
- `GET /api/user/tickets` - List user's tickets
- `POST /api/user/tickets` - Create new ticket
- `GET /api/user/tickets/{id}` - Get ticket details
